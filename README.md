Chat App allows the user to chat with other people. Before joining a room, the user must choose a username unique to the room he or she wishes to join. A list of all rooms is shown to the user; any user can join any existing room or create a new room. When a new user joins a room, a welcome message from the Admin will be displayed to the new user and a message notifying that a new user has joined will be shown to all other users in that room. A list of all users in the room is displayed on the room screen. Users can enter a message into the input field and click on the 'Send' button or press the Enter key to send the message to all other users in the room. Users can also press the 'My current location' button to send a link that leads to their actual location shown on Google Maps. When a user leaves the room page, a message from Admin will notify all other users in the room about the user which has left, and that user's name will be removed from the list of users in the room. If all users leave a room, that room will be removed from the list of rooms a new user can join. This app was built using socket.io and tested using Mocha.
To test the app, enter the same room from multiple tabs and send messages between them.
